Hugin is a messaging service where messages are relayed by other users and Hugin nodes.
Your messages are secured with industry leading encryption so that only you and your chat partner have the possibility to read them.
**The purpose** is **not** to gather any personal information about the users, unlike most apps and social media.

Hugin also packs some powerful decentralized P2P encrypted features like **video, voice**, **screen sharing** and **filesharing**.

# CI/CD

This project is automatically built, tested and deployed using GitHub Actions. We have two pipelines:

- **Main Pipeline** - This is the pipeline that runs the code merged into our main branch.
- **Pull Request Pipeline** - This is the pipeline that runs each time a pull request come in so the reviewer has some help evaluating if the code is good enough to be merged.

The Main Pipeline do everything the Pull Request Pipeline does in addition to building and publishing artifacts of different architectures and OS.

# Contribute

## Pull Request

We appreciate all contributions whether it be small changes such as documentation of source code to major improvement of code. The easiest way is to make a fork and then make a pull request into our main branch. To make the PR go through make sure to include this information:

```
